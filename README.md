# GenomeMatrix
In the analysis of HiC or similar types of interaction data, it is useful to 
plot matrices while rotating them by -45 degrees. My motivation to write this 
function was to visualize HiC data along with other genomic tracks, such as 
gene annotations (using ggbio) and chromatin marks. The result are plots like the
one below:
